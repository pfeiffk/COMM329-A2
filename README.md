# COMM329-A2

Final efforts for this project have been completed as of 2/20/2019.
-----------------------------------------------

//--ERROR ANALYSIS--//
Despite many attempts to find a solution, the lower grid fails below ~440px. 
At the breaking point, all grid boxes do not resize to fit within the browser window. A temporary solution was reached, by hiding overflow in the x-direction.

Solution attempts may have failed due to the abnormal structuring of the over-all grid itself. Attempts to find a solution for this specific issue may have been valid, with the grid-structure causing further issues to come up. Due to this realization, efforts have been ceased in order to complete the assignment within a reasonable time-frame. A full solution to this problem may require fully starting over. 

//--OTHER STATEMENTS--//
All other functionality appears to be working properly. 
Text content for the page was provided by cheese ipsum, cupcake ipsum, and what I believe to be Futurama quotes(a tv show quote based ipsum).
City links within the body of the page will lead to an external google map for that location.
If able, I would restart the project in order to get the page functioning at all screen sizes.
